# AS4PA final project
As a final project of the course, together with [Paolo Zinesi](https://github.com/PaoloZinesi), we implemented a Naive Bayes classifier for Fake News recognition, in the context of social media posts. More information can be found in the repository of the project: [Fake News recognition](https://github.com/NicolaZomer/NB_for_fake_news_recognition). The resulting Shiny app is available [here](https://nicolazomer.shinyapps.io/fake-news-recognition/).

# AS4PA exercises
Below you can find all the exercises carried out during the course. To download them in Rmd format, follow the link to the GitHub repository.
* [Exercises R Laboratory 01](./AS4PA_Solutions/exercises_rlab_01.html) <br>
  First exercises in R to become familiar with the syntax and to start writing some basic instructions. In particular, the last one consists of a brief analysis of Covid-19 Vaccine data.

# Statistical Mechanics of Complex Systems projects
**[Application of the MaxEnt Principle](./Complex_Systems_Projects/Application-of-the-MaxEnt-Principle.html)** <br>
The MaxEnt principle can be used to find the less biased probability distribution compatible with a set of constraints, by maximizing the Shannon entropy subject to these constraints. In this project I apply the MaxEnt principle to some data, genered according to a known distribution, using the measured k-th moments as constraints. I consider only one simple discrete case, but in the future it would be interesting to apply this study on well-known continuous distributions such as the Gaussian and the Exponential.

**[Noise-induced schooling of fish](./Complex_Systems_Projects/Schooling-of-Fish.html)** <br>
In this project we want to simulate the dynamics of schools of fish and compare the results with those shown in the article [ Noise-induced schooling of fish](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-020-0787-y). In particular, we focus on a mean field model based on pairwise interactions. 

The project was carried out together with [Alberto Coppi](https://github.com/c0pp1).
