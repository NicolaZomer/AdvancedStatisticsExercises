# AS4PA exercises
Below you can find all the exercises carried out during the course. To download them in Rmd format, follow the link to the GitHub repository.
* [Exercises R Laboratory 01](./AS4PA_Solutions/exercises_rlab_01.html) <br>
  First exercises in R to become familiar with the syntax and to start writing some basic instructions. In particular, the last one consists of a brief analysis of Covid19 Vaccine data.
  
* [Exercises R Laboratory 02](./AS4PA_Solutions/exercises_rlab_02.html)
  * Review of basic probability concepts
  * Probability distributions in R
* [Exercises R Laboratory 03](./AS4PA_Solutions/exercises_rlab_03.html)
  * Random numbers generation
  * Markov’s inequality
  * Chebyshev’s inequality
  * The Six Boxes Toy Model: inference and simulation ([resulting plot of my inference simulation](https://github.com/NicolaZomer/R_AdvStatistics_and_ComplexSystems/blob/main/AS4PA_Solutions/results/6_boxes_toy_model.html))

# Statistical Mechanics of Complex Systems projects
[Application of the MaxEnt Principle](./Complex_Systems_Projects/Application-of-the-MaxEnt-Principle.html) <br>
The MaxEnt principle can be used to find the less biased probability distribution compatible with a set of constraints, by maximizing the Shannon entropy subject to these constraints. In this project I apply the MaxEnt principle to some data, genered according to a known distribution, using the measured k-th moments as constraints. I start with a simple discrete case and then move on to well-known continuous distributions such as the Gaussian and the Exponential.
