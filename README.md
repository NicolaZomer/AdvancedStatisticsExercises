# R Programming: advanced statistics and complex systems 
**For a better view of the repository and the R codes it is recommended to use the following link: [R_AdvStatistics_and_ComplexSystems](https://nicolazomer.github.io/R_AdvStatistics_and_ComplexSystems/).**

## Content of the repository
This repository is mainly realized following the path of the [Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2021/LM/SC/SC2443/000ZZ/SCP8082557/N0) course and contains my solutions of the exercises assigned by Professor Garfagnini. 

In addition to this, I also present here some works related to the [Statistical Mechanics of Complex System](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2021/LM/SC/SC2443/000ZZ/SCP8082536/N0) course, held by Professor Maritan. This works are collected in the folder [Complex_Systems_Projects](./Complex_Systems_Projects).

All projects are carried out in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). 

## Folders
The folder [AS4PA_Assignments](./AS4PA_Assignments) contains the instructions for the exercises provided by Professor Garfagnini, while in the folder [AS4PA_Solutions](./AS4PA_Solutions) you can find my solutions, both in `Rmd` and `html` format. 

Instead, as written above, the folder [Complex_Systems_Projects](./Complex_Systems_Projects) contains my personal works related to the course of complex systems (currently only one), again in `Rmd` and `html` format.
