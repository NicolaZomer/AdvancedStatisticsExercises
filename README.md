# R Programming: advanced statistics and complex systems 
This repository is mainly realized following the path of the [Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2021/LM/SC/SC2443/000ZZ/SCP8082557/N0) course and contains my solutions of the exercises assigned by Professor Garfagnini. 

In addition to this, I also present here some works related to the [Statistical Mechanics of Complex System](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2021/LM/SC/SC2443/000ZZ/SCP8082536/N0) course, held by Professor Maritan. This works are collected in the folder [Complex_Systems_Projects](./Complex_Systems_Projects).

All projects are carried out in R. 

## Visualization of the repository
For a better view of the repository and the R codes it is recommended to use the following link: [AdvancedStatisticsExercises](https://nicolazomer.github.io/AdvancedStatisticsExercises/).
