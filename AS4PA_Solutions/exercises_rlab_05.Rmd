# Exercise 1
The number of particles emitted by a radioactive source during a fixed interval of time ($\Delta t=10s$) follows a Poisson distribution on the parameter $\mu$. The number of particles observed during
consecutive time intervals is: 4, 1, 3, 1 and 3. 

### a) Suppose a uniform prior distribution for the parameter $\mu$
* Determine and draw the posterior distribution for $\mu$, given the data

```{r}

```

* Evaluate mean, median and variance, both analytically and numerically in R

```{r}

```

### b) Suppose a Jeffrey's prior for the parameter $\mu$
* Determine and draw the posterior distribution for $\mu$, given the data

```{r}

```

* Evaluate mean, median and variance, both analytically and numerically in R

```{r}

```

### c) Evaluate a 95% credibility interval for the results obtained with both priors
Compare the result with that obtained using a normal approximation for the posterior distribution, with the same mean and standard deviation.

# Exercise 2
Given the problem of the lighthouse discussed last week, study the case in which both the position along the shore ($\alpha$) and the distance out at sea ($\beta$) are unknown.

# Exercise 3
Given the Signal over Background example discussed last week, analyze and discuss the following cases:

### a) Vary the sampling resolution used to generate the data, keeping the same sampling range

`xdat <- seq(from=-7*w, to=7*w, by=0.5*w)`

* change the resolution $w = {0.1,  0.25,  1,  2, 3}
* check the effect on the results

```{r}

```

### b) Change the ration A/B used to simulate the data (keeping both positive in accordance with the prior)
* check the effect on the results

```{r}

```
